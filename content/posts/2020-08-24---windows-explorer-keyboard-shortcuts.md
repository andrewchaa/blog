One of the key ideas in [Progmatic Programmer](https://pragprog.com/) is achieving editor fluency by learning keyboard shortcuts. Ever since I read the book, i had become a shortcut man.

| Command | Shortcut |
| :--- | :--- |
| Go Back | Alt  + Left |
| Go Forward | Alt + Right |
| Select the Address Bar | Ctrl + L |
